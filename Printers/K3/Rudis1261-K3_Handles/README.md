## K3 Handles

You may need some handles to pick up your new chunky boi. These handles bolt to the side panel frames, which should ensure that you can pick up and move your K3 around without issues.

### Print settings
- Many perimeters 8
- Infil > 50% infill
- Infil type rectilinear
- Solid Top/bottom layers (8)
- Layer height .25mm alternatively .2mm (Thicker should have better layer strength)

### Printing notes
**NOTE** You want these to be as solid as possible. Make sure you can't break the handle by twisting it before installing them on your K3.
